{"name":"locfdr-python","tagline":"Python implementation of locfdr v1.1-7, which computes local false discovery rates.","body":"locfdr-python v0.1\r\n==================\r\n\r\nlocfdr-python is a Python variant of Efron, Turnbull, and Narasimhan's R function locfdr() v1.1-7, which computes local false discovery rates. See http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/locfdr/ for more information.\r\n\r\nThis port is very literal interpretation of Frazee, Collado-Torres, and Leek's augmented version of locfdr at https://github.com/alyssafrazee/derfinder/blob/master/R/locfdrFit.R : the organization of the code parallels the original where efficient, and variable and function names are the same as in R. Rfunctions.py contains Python functions designed to mimic R's idiosyncratic implementations of interpolation.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Python 2.7.x, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and statsmodels. The code was tested on the latest version of Anaconda as of 9/14/2013, which contains Python 2.7.5, scipy 0.12.0, numpy 1.7.1, pandas 0.12.0, statsmodels 0.5.0, and matplotlib 1.3.0. This distribution is available at https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS LICENSED UNDER THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE VERSION 2. See COPYING for more information.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------------\r\nDownload zip or tarball, unpack all files in the same directory, and run\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n    from locfdr import locfdr\r\n    # Here, initialize zz, a list or numpy array of summary statistics\r\n    results = locfdr(zz)\r\n\r\n### R vs. Python\r\n\r\nThe port is relatively faithful. Variable names are almost precisely the same; if the original variable name contained a period, that period is replaced by an underscore in the Python. (So 'Cov2.out' in the R is 'Cov2_out' in the Python.)\r\n\r\nTo access returned values:\r\n\r\n(R)\r\n\r\n    results = locfdr(...)\r\n    results$fdr\r\n    results$z.2\r\n\t\r\n(Corresponding Python)\r\n\r\n    results = locfdr(...)\r\n    results['fdr']\r\n    results['z_2']\r\n\r\nSome returned values are pandas Series and DataFrames. An introduction to pandas data structures is available at http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/dsintro.html .\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nStart the Python interpreter, and enter\r\n\r\n    >>> execfile('example.py')\r\n\r\nThis is the simulation of Section 4 from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/locfdr/vignettes/locfdr-example.pdf . Compare with results in R.\r\n\r\nMore details\r\n-----------------\r\nSee the locfdr pydoc, or view the source of locfdr.py .\r\n","google":"UA-28011603-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
